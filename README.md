## 📋 Overview
To reduce adverse environmental impacts of fossil fuel burning for electricity production, more solar photovoltaic (PV) and battery energy storage systems (BESS) are being added to the grid. Local microgrids consisting of these newer technologies offer reliable and cost effective power to many buildings.  Weill Institute located at Bakersfield College is in the process of implementing a modern microgrid.

## 🎯 Objective
This is a research project under the California Renewable Energy Laboratory (CREL) Microgrid Dashboard Project in collaboration with the Kern College Community District (KCCD), University of California Riverside (UCR), and the Weill Institute.

There are three groups involved in this project:
- [ ] Group 1: Microgrid – Data Acquisition and Management
- [x] <mark>**Group 2: Dashboard – Graphical User Interface (GUI) Development**</mark>
- [ ] Group 3: Microgrid – Cost Saving and Environmental Benefits Optimization

The purpose of this program/website is to create a graphical user interface dashboard for the Weill Institute's microgrid to demonstrate information regarding the building's usage of power in real time.

## 🌱 Areas for Improvement
- Use Modbus protocol to collect data from the microgrid
- Store the data in a MySQL database
- Visualize the data on a dashboard by querying the database
- Add interactive elements with React
